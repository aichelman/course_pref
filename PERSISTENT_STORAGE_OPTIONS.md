# Making Login/Data Persistent - Complete Guide

## The Problem

Your app DOES save logins to a database (SQLite), but on Render's free tier, the database file is stored in `/tmp` which gets wiped when the service restarts. This causes all user accounts and data to disappear.

## Solutions (Ranked by Recommendation)

---

## ⭐ Option 1: Add Free PostgreSQL Database (RECOMMENDED)

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Data persists forever (no resets)
- ✅ Better for multiple concurrent users
- ✅ Professional database solution
- ✅ Keep Render free tier for hosting

**How it works:**
```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Render Free     │         │ Free PostgreSQL DB   │
│ (Flask App)     │────────▶│ (Supabase/Neon)     │
│                 │         │ Data persists here!  │
└─────────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘
```

**Cost:** FREE
**Effort:** 30 minutes to set up

### Free PostgreSQL Options:

1. **Supabase** (BEST)
   - 500MB storage free
   - Unlimited API requests
   - Easy setup
   - URL: https://supabase.com

2. **Neon**
   - 3GB storage free
   - Serverless Postgres
   - URL: https://neon.tech

3. **ElephantSQL**
   - 20MB storage free (enough for thousands of users)
   - Simple setup
   - URL: https://www.elephantsql.com

4. **Render PostgreSQL Free**
   - 90 days then expires
   - 1GB storage
   - Built into Render

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Sign up for Supabase** (or another option)
2. **Create a new project** - you'll get a PostgreSQL connection URL
3. **I'll update your code** to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
4. **Add environment variable** on Render with database URL
5. **Deploy** - data now persists forever!

**Pros:**
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Better than SQLite for web apps
- ✅ Scales better
- ✅ Professional solution

**Cons:**
- Requires ~30 min setup
- Need to update code slightly

## Option 2: Upgrade to Render Paid Plan

**Cost:** $7/month
**Effort:** 5 minutes

**What you get:**
- Persistent disk storage (SQLite keeps working)
- No sleep time (always fast)
- Better performance
- Support persistent disk

**How to upgrade:**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click your service
3. "Upgrade Plan" → Starter ($7/mo)
4. Add persistent disk at `/data`
5. Update code to use `/data/courses.db`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick setup
- ✅ No code changes needed (minimal)
- ✅ Everything just works

**Cons:**
- ❌ Costs $7/month
- ❌ SQLite still not ideal for concurrent users

---

## Option 3: Switch Hosting Platforms

### Railway
- Better free tier
- $5 credit/month included
- Persistent storage on free tier
- Easy migration from Render

### Fly.io
- Persistent volumes on free tier
- More generous free tier
- Slightly more complex setup

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free or cheap
- ✅ Better free tier features

**Cons:**
- Requires migration
- Learning new platform

---

## Option 4: Keep Current Setup (Accept Limitations)

**Cost:** FREE
**Effort:** 0 minutes

**What it means:**
- App works great while running
- UptimeRobot keeps it awake
- Data only resets during:
  - New deployments (when I push updates)
  - Render maintenance (rare)
  - Manual restarts

**Reality check:**
- With UptimeRobot running, resets are pretty rare
- Maybe once a week or less
- Users just re-register when it happens

**Pros:**
- ✅ No cost
- ✅ No setup needed
- ✅ Works well enough for casual use

**Cons:**
- ❌ Occasional data resets
- ❌ Not suitable for serious use

## Want Me to Implement PostgreSQL?

If you want to go with the PostgreSQL option (my recommendation), just:

1. Sign up at https://supabase.com
2. Create a new project
3. Get your connection string (looks like: `postgresql://...`)
4. Give me the connection string
5. I'll update all the code and we'll deploy!

It'll take 30 minutes total and solve the problem permanently for free.
